                    <p>Most chicken scallopini recipes call for a lemon-caper sauce, which makes the dish almost
                        indistinguishable from chicken piccata. So just what is chicken scallopini? It comes from the
                        Italian word “scaloppine,” which translates to “small scallops” but has now taken on the meaning
                        of
                        a piece of thinly sliced meat. </p>
                    <p>
                        Chicken scallopini can be cooked in a variety of sauces and flavors. We departed from the
                        piccata
                        herd and went instead for tender mushrooms and a hint of wine, lemon, and broth, capped off with
                        a
                        dash of rich cream: scaloppine ai funghi. Cheers to a perfectly light yet hearty weeknight meal.

                    <p>Ceviche, also cebiche, seviche, or sebiche,(Spanish pronunciation: [seˈβitʃe]) is a Latin
                        American seafood dish that may have originated in Peru, typically made from fresh raw fish
                        cured in fresh citrus juices, most commonly lemon or lime, and spiced with ají, chili peppers or
                        other seasonings including chopped onions, salt, and coriander.</p>
                    <p>
                        Because the dish is eaten raw, and not cooked with heat, it must be prepared fresh and consumed
                        immediately to minimize the risk of food poisoning.Although Ceviche is often eaten as an
                        appetizer, if eaten as a main dish it is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its
                        flavours, such as sweet potato, lettuce, maize, avocado, or cooking banana.

                    <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and
                        salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, vegetables, and
                        occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
                        ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.</p>
                    <p>
                        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown
                        rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel,
                        yellowtail,
                        salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with
                        pickled
                        ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular
                        garnishes
                        for the dish.
