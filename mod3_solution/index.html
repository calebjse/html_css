                <p class="menu-details">Ceviche, also cebiche, seviche, or sebiche,(Spanish pronunciation: [seˈβitʃe]) is a Latin
                    American seafood dish that may have originated in Peru, typically made from fresh raw fish
                    cured in fresh citrus juices, most commonly lemon or lime, and spiced with ají, chili peppers or
                    other seasonings including chopped onions, salt, and coriander.
                </p>
                <p class="menu-details">
                    Because the dish is eaten raw, and not cooked with heat, it must be prepared fresh and consumed
                    immediately to minimize the risk of food poisoning.Although Ceviche is often eaten as an
                    appetizer, if eaten as a main dish it is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its
                    flavours, such as sweet potato, lettuce, maize, avocado, or cooking banana.
                </p>
                <p class="menu-details">
                    The dish is popular in the Pacific coastal regions of western Latin America. Though the origin
                    of ceviche is disputed, in Peru it is considered a national dish. Though archeological records
                    suggest that something resembling ceviche may have been consumed in Peru nearly two thousand years
                    ago, the dominant position Lima held through four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of
                    Peru allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the
                    region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and
                    styles.

                <p class="menu-details">
                    Ceviche is now a popular international dish prepared in a variety of ways throughout the Americas,
                    reaching the United States in the 1980s. The greatest variety of ceviches are found in Peru,
                    Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile, but other distinctly unique styles can also be found in coastal
                    Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, the United States, Mexico, Panama, and several other
                    nations.
